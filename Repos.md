# Summary Of Projects/Repos

## Public Repos

### petermatts (This Repo)

This repo is for my GitHub profile.

The main README.md contains the main overview. Including how I came up with my github username. In the readme I gave a code form explanation. 

This repository has this code saved in different popular languages (Java, Javascript, Python, C, C++) with more to come maybe. 

This file contains a deeper dive into my repositories where I even describe some of my private repos that you cannot see.

### NFL Season Predictor

[![Readme Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=petermatts&repo=nfl-season-predictor)](https://github.com/petermatts/nfl-season-predictor)

Coding project build using React and JS to display NFL games and allow a user to pick a winner (and/or a loser) or even a tie.

It then generates and updates a live playoffs standings/seeding for all the teams by confrence or division.

I got my inspiration for this from the video where Adam Rank predicted the San Francisco 49ers to go 3-13 when they actually ended up going 13-3 and reaching the superbowl. You can see the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzQORLyBCI4). But my main take away was the screen he was tapping and using to pick games.

I was like I want to be able to do that but could not find anything online. So I took it into my own hands and made such a tool.

### Heart

A Python project the Turtle package to draw a heart and the pyinstaller package to generate the executible file to draw the heart anytime.

I made this for my girlfriend ❤️

### CarStats

A python code project that will (still under construction in my free time) web scrape car specifications from the reliable [www.caranddriver.com](https://caranddriver.com).

## Private Repos

### UMASS

Repository to store all code homework/projects from my undergraduate courses at University of Massachusetts Amherst.

### LotterySim

Webscrapes popular lotteries like the Powerball or Megamillions for number frequencies and computes statistics on this data to generate which numbers (should) be most likely to come up soon, if any.

Repository may be made public at some point but be warned...

If you use it and win you owe me a cut :)

### InstaFF

New project. I haven't started it yet but the idea is to: have code that will login into your Instagram (provided with your credentials) and return to you a comparison (set difference and union) between the users you follow and the users that follow you.

This project will be made public at some point in the future.

## Future/Current Projects

### Current
- Car Comparer
- Lottery Sim/Prob calculator
- Add `Repos.md` to `petermatts` repo and add Name program files in other languages
- Instagram analyzer (compute set difference of followers vs following)

### Future
- Stock Analyzer
- Runtime Analysis Parser
  <!-- - parse through code and generate a runtime analysis in big-O notation -->
