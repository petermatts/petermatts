## Public Repos

### petermatts (This Repo)

This repo is for my GitHub profile.

The main README.md contains the main overview. Including how I came up with my github username. In the readme I gave a code form explanation. 

This repository has this code saved in different popular languages likes Java, Javascript, Python, C, C++ and more!

This file contains a deeper dive into my repositories where I even describe some of my private repos that you cannot see.

### NFL Season Predictor

![My Skills](https://go-skill-icons.vercel.app/api/icons?i=nodejs,js,react,redux,html,css,firebase&titles=true)

Coding project build using React and JS to display NFL games and allow a user to pick a winner (and/or a loser) or even a tie.

It then generates and updates a live playoffs standings/seeding for all the teams by confrence or division.

I got my inspiration for this from the video where Adam Rank predicted the San Francisco 49ers to go 3-13 when they actually ended up going 13-3 and reaching the superbowl. You can see the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzQORLyBCI4). But my main take away was the screen he was tapping and using to pick games.

I was like I want to be able to do that but could not find anything online. So I took it into my own hands and made such a tool.

Try out the webapp [NFL Season Predictor](https://nfl-season-predictor.web.app/)

### Heart 

![My Skills](https://go-skill-icons.vercel.app/api/icons?i=python&titles=true)

A Python project using the Turtle package to draw a heart and the pyinstaller package to generate the executible file to draw the heart anytime.

I made this for my girlfriend ❤️

### CarSnap and CarSnap-AI

![My Skills](https://go-skill-icons.vercel.app/api/icons?i=nodejs,js,reactnative,html,css,virtualbox,xcode,python,huggingface&titles=true)

Mobile app for car spotting, (likely personal project beginning work Summer 2025). Utilizing React Native, Databases, ML, etc. Details to come.

[![Readme Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=petermatts&theme=transparent&repo=CarSnap-AI)](https://github.com/petermatts/CarSnap-AI)

### Cubik

![My Skills](https://go-skill-icons.vercel.app/api/icons?i=cpp,cmake,python&titles=true)

C++ implementation of a Rubix cube. Compiled using CMake and wrapped using SWIG to generate a python module backed in C++ for fast search and AI algorithms to solve the cube.

[![Readme Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=petermatts&theme=transparent&repo=cubik)](https://github.com/petermatts/cubik)

<!-- - ML Rubik's Cube Solver
  - See how well we can train a machine learning model to solve a Rubik's cube
  - Use the WCA scramble generator to generate scrambled cube states for training, validation, and testing
  - Use neuralnets/transformers + reinforcement learning?
  - Potential difficulties
    - Measuring loss/distance from solved state (We know God's number is $O(20)$ but a particular state will be difficult to evaluate) -->

### LotterySim

![My Skills](https://go-skill-icons.vercel.app/api/icons?i=python,pytorch,numpy,scipy,java&titles=true)

Webscrapes popular lotteries like the Powerball or Megamillions for number frequencies and computes statistics on this data to generate which numbers (should) be most likely to come up soon, if any. Java was used previously in older code for this project but has since been removed in favor of python.

Upcoming features: better data saving which will lead to new statistical and ML models for this application.

Repository may be made public at some point but be warned...

If you use it and win you owe me a cut :)

### ExtraBits

Repository containiny miscellaneous code that I have written over the years.

### CarStats 
(*Archived*)

![My Skills](https://go-skill-icons.vercel.app/api/icons?i=python,selenium,yaml,regex,pandas,matplotlib&titles=true)

A python code project that will (still under construction in my free time) web scrape car specifications from the awesome [www.caranddriver.com](https://caranddriver.com) up to 2023/2024. After which data will be maintained manually.

### QNNs
(Archived)

![](https://go-skill-icons.vercel.app/api/icons?i=matlab,python,pandas,numpy&titles=true)

This repo aims to expirement with simulated Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) using Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC) Layers. More specifically, it aims to expirement with their ability to learn linear vs nonlinear data with as few model structure changes as possible.

## Private Repos

### UMASS

![](https://go-skill-icons.vercel.app/api/icons?i=java,c,python,pytorch,numpy,sklearn,scipy,matlab,latex,js,nodejs,html,css,asm,huggingface,kaggle,jupyter)

Repository to store all code homework/projects from my undergraduate courses at University of Massachusetts Amherst.

This repository will remain private to the end of time as per univerity policy.

<!-- ### AlgoTiming

![](https://go-skill-icons.vercel.app/api/icons?i=python,cpp)

This is a project containing code accross various different languages implementing popular algorithms (like various sorting algorithms) and comparing the runtime across languages and algorithms.

Part of the incentive here is to familarize myself with, at least the basics of, as many languages as I can. -->

<!-- ### StockAnalyzer

![](https://go-skill-icons.vercel.app/api/icons?i=python,pytorch,numpy)

A project with the goal of modeling stock exchange tickers using machine learning and fourier analysis (over both short and longterm). A few Ideas I have to further improve the performance/projections is to take into account recent event biases, perhaps by analyzing news articles that refer to a certain ticker or its market. These kinds of ML models (article analysis) do exist, I worked on one as part of a final project in my junoir year of my undergrad.

Still in early stages of development. Probably won't get around to this for a while. -->

## Future Projects and Ideas
- Personal Website
  - A website to display my portfolio of projects and work.
  - A much better version of everything I am showing in my GitHub profile.
  - Buy some web domain that has my name in it?
- Algorithm Database
  - Library/documentation of all algorithms
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms
  - Like a application that displays all algorithms categorized
    - number theoretic, graph, sort, etc.
  - Under each algorithm would be pseudo code, maybe some real code, possible proofs,
    and references to paper that introduced the algorithm
  - Need to devise a way to get all information into application
    - Manual additions (like wikipedia?)
    - AI/webscraping?
- ProofAI
  - Develope an AI model that can derive new mathematical/computational proofs from known proven facts.
  - Utilize a 'tree-like' structure starting from base assumptions like the [Peano Axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms) and build from there.
  - Complication: I have no idea how to go about constructing a model for this, let alone how to gather the data.
  - Build off of some of the research papers that have explored this 
    - [Proof Automation with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14274)
    - [ProofNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12433v1)
- ML Meme Audio Detection Counter
  - count the "bwomps" (or other sound effects) in Spongebob
  - count the number of times Jeremy Clarkson says "Yeeeeees" or "Jaaaag"
  - etc.
  - Issue is how to get the data...
- CARd Game
  - Similar to the CarSnap repo above, but like a card game?
  - Different card types and rarities (collectable)
  - Basically like a *Magic The Gathering* type game but where each car has a card
  - For example an epic rarity card could be like a Ferrari 458 and a common could be a Honda Civic
  - Different years and trims included on cards
  - Descriptions and fun facts too perhaps
- Car Consumer Notes
  - A redo of the CarStats repo above
  - Should implement a better methodology of dataset creation - webscraping is inefficient/unreliable overtime with website changes, manual dataset curation is too tedious.
- Latex Auto Rename/Close Tag
  - Like the auto close/auto rename tag VSCode extensions for HTML and XML, but for the `\begin{}` and `\end{}` sequences in Latex
  - Should be as easy as forking one of the existing extensions and altering it towards latex
